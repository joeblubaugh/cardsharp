#Cardsharp#

A command-line program for keeping track of cards that remain in a deck 
in a "card drawing" game. I made this to help myself improve at
[Sage Solitaire](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sage-solitaire/id1004646445?mt=8)

## How-To ##
1. Install [npyscreen](https://bitbucket.org/npcole/npyscreen).
2. Run cardsharp.py.

## Commands ##
- **:2D** removes the 2 of Diamonds
- **:0S 3c** removes the 10 of Spades and the 3 of Clubs
- **:u** undoes the last removal
- **:reset** resets the deck
- **:q** quits
